# Exercise 1 â€” Sum of Evens; Sum of Odds
# Write a program that computes three sums:

# 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + 99 + 100

# 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + ... + 97 + 99

# 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + ... + 98 + 100
# Use a register (say $8) for the sum of evens, a register (say $9) for the sum of odds, and another (say $10) for the sum of all numbers.
# Do this with one counting loop. The loop body contains logic to add the count to the proper sums.
